This guide assumes you have already created a mnemonic for each cosigner that will be in your multisig wallet. If that is not the case, head over to the [Generating a Mnemonic](../generating-a-mnemonic) page and complete those steps first.

When entering your mnemonics into Krux, make sure to select *Multisig* for all keys in your multisig. The choice of single-sig vs. multisig at this point will change the derivation path used to generate your master extended public key (xpub) which will affect how wallet software handles it.

<img src="../../img/maixpy_amigo_tft/wallet-type-options-multisig-150.png">

Selecting `Multisig` will derive an xpub using the derivation path `m/48'/0'/0'/2'` on mainnet and `m/48'/1'/0'/2'` on testnet, which indicates to wallet software that a [Multisig Wallet script type](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0048.mediawiki) should be used, specifically the Native Segwit script `P2WSH`, or just `wsh`.

## Create the wallet

=== "Specter Desktop"

    In Specter Desktop, you will need to import your public key by adding a new device. Press the *Add new device* button on the left side of the app.

    <img src="../../img/specter/add-new-device-button-400.png">

    Krux is not listed as one of the available device types on the *Add Device* screen, so you will need to select the *Other* option.

    <img src="../../img/specter/select-device-type-screen-600.png">

    You will be taken to the *Upload Keys* screen where you can choose to *Scan QR code*.

    <img src="../../img/specter/upload-keys-screen-600.png">

    On your Krux, navigate to the *Extended Public Key* option under the main menu and show the **first** QR code to Specter Desktop.

    <img src="../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/extended-public-key-wsh-xpub-qr-125.png">
    <img src="../../img/maixpy_amigo_tft/extended-public-key-wsh-xpub-qr-150.png">

    It should import the xpub and display the *Purpose* as *#0 Multisig Sig (Segwit)*.

    <img src="../../img/specter/multisig-segwit-key-600.png">

    Give the device a name and press *Continue*. You should see the new device in the devices list on the left side of the app.

    <img src="../../img/specter/multisig-demo-device-400.png">

    Repeat this process for every key that will be in your multisig wallet.

    Once all key devices have been added, you can make a wallet using them. Press the *Add new wallet* button on the left side of the app.

    <img src="../../img/specter/add-new-wallet-button-400.png">

    Choose to create a *Multisignature wallet* when it asks which type of wallet you want on the following screen.

    <img src="../../img/specter/select-wallet-type-screen-multisig-400.png">

    Select the devices you just added and press *Continue*.

    <img src="../../img/specter/pick-device-screen-multisig-400.png">

    Give your wallet a name, make sure to select *Segwit* for the wallet type, and decide how many of your keys are required to sign a transaction, then press *Create wallet*.

    <img src="../../img/specter/create-multisig-wallet-screen-600.png">

    Congrats, you just created a multisig wallet!
    
=== "Sparrow"

    In Sparrow, create a new wallet by going to *File > New Wallet* and give it a name.
    
    <img src="../../img/sparrow/new-multisig-wallet-400.png">

    On the wallet screen, make sure to select a *Multi Signature* policy type with the *Native Segwit (P2WSH)* script type. Here you can decide how many keys will be in your multisig and how many should be required to sign a transaction.

    <img src="../../img/sparrow/multisig-wallet-settings-600.png">

    Now, you will need to import your public key. To do so, press the *Airgapped Hardware Wallet* button under *Keystores*. On the screen that pops up, Krux is not listed as one of the available device types, so look for the *Specter DIY* option and click its *Scan...* button.

    <img src="../../img/sparrow/specter-diy-scan-qr-400.png">

    On your Krux, navigate to the *Extended Public Key* option under the main menu and show the **first** QR code to Sparrow.

    <img src="../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/extended-public-key-wsh-xpub-qr-125.png">
    <img src="../../img/maixpy_amigo_tft/extended-public-key-wsh-xpub-qr-150.png">

    It should import the xpub and show a key under *Keystores* like the following:

    <img src="../../img/sparrow/keystore-multisig-key-settings-600.png">

    Repeat this process for every key that will be in your multisig wallet.

    Once all keys have been added, click the blue *Apply* button to create your wallet.

    Congrats, you just created a multisig wallet!

=== "BlueWallet"

    In BlueWallet, create a new wallet by either pressing the *+* button or scrolling to the right until you see the *Add now* button.

    <img src="../../img/blue/add-wallet-button-400.png">

    On the screen that pops up, add a name for your wallet, tap on *Vault*, and tap *Create* to begin creating a multisig wallet. 
    
    <img src="../../img/blue/add-wallet-vault-400.png">

    On the following screen, you can proceed with the defaults or adjust the number of cosigners (default is 2-of-3) as needed by going into the Vault Settings. Make sure to leave the script type as `p2wsh`. 
    
    <img src="../../img/blue/new-vault-lets-start-400.png">

    <img src="../../img/blue/new-vault-settings-400.png">

    Continue and you will be taken to a screen where you can import your keys.

    Tap *Import* under the first *Vault Key*.

    <img src="../../img/blue/new-vault-scan-key-400.png">

    Tap again on *Scan or import a file* to begin scanning a QR code.

    On your Krux, navigate to the *Extended Public Key* option under the main menu and show the **first** QR code to BlueWallet.
    
    <img src="../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/extended-public-key-wsh-xpub-qr-125.png">
    <img src="../../img/maixpy_amigo_tft/extended-public-key-wsh-xpub-qr-150.png">

    You should see a green checkmark next to the key if successful.

    <img src="../../img/blue/new-vault-add-key-success-400.png">

    Repeat this process for every key that will be in your multisig wallet.

    Once all keys have been added, tap *Create*.

    <img src="../../img/blue/new-vault-create-400.png">

    From here, you can send or receive.

    <img src="../../img/blue/multisig-wallet-home-400.png">

    Congrats, you just created a multisig wallet!

## Load the wallet into Krux

**Note:** While not required, it is strongly recommended to load your multisig wallet into Krux before signing a PSBT as it will allow the device to verify that the transaction it is signing has the correct list of cosigners as defined in the wallet. It is also useful if you wish to [print a backup](../printing) of the wallet or visually inspect the list of cosigners being output by your wallet coordinator.

=== "Specter Desktop"

    Load the wallet into Krux by going to the *Settings* page in Specter Desktop, then click the *Export* tab. There, press the *Export* button to display a QR code of your wallet.

    <img src="../../img/specter/export-wallet-screen-600.png">
