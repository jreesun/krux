This guide assumes you have already created a mnemonic. If that is not the case, head over to the [Generating a Mnemonic](../generating-a-mnemonic) page and complete those steps first.

=== "Specter Desktop"

    ## Create the wallet

    First, enter your mnemonic into Krux and make sure to select *Single-key* before proceeding. The choice of single-key vs. multisig at this point will change the derivation information used to generate your extended master public key (xpub) which will affect how Specter Desktop classifies it.

    In Specter Desktop, you will need to import your public key by adding a new device. Press the *Add new device* button on the left side of the app.

    Krux is not listed as one of the available device types on the *Add Device* screen, so you will need to select the *Other* option.

    You will be taken to the *Upload Keys* screen where you can choose to *Scan QR code*.

    <img src="../../img/specter/upload-keys-screen.png" width="600">

    On your Krux, navigate to the *Public Key (xpub)* option under the main menu and show this QR code to Specter Desktop.

    <img src="../../img/pic-xpub.png" width="100">

    It should import the xpub and display the *Purpose* as *#0 Single Sig (Segwit)*.

    Give the device a name and press *Continue*. You should now see the device in the devices list on the left side of the app.

    Now that you've added a device with your key to Specter Desktop, you can make a wallet using it. Press the *Add new wallet* button on the left side of the app.

    <img src="../../img/specter/add-new-wallet-button.png" width="400">

    Choose to create a *Single key wallet* when it asks which type of wallet you want on the following screen.

    <img src="../../img/specter/select-wallet-type-screen.png" width="400">

    Now, select the device you just added.

    <img src="../../img/specter/pick-device-screen.png" width="400">

    Give your wallet a name and make sure to select *Segwit* for the wallet type, then press *Create wallet*.

    Congrats, you just created a single-key wallet with your key!
    
    ## Receive coins

    The next screen should show your first receive address that you can send funds to.

    ## Load the wallet

    Now, load the wallet into Krux by going to the *Settings* page in Specter Desktop, then click the *Export* tab. There, press the *Export* button to display a QR code of your wallet.

    <img src="../../img/specter/export-wallet-screen.png" width="600">

    In Krux, select the *Wallet* menu item option and scan the QR code.

    <img src="../../img/pic-load-wallet-prompt.png" width="100">

    If it worked, Krux should display the wallet information that it loaded:

    ## Send coins

    Now, you can send funds! Go to *Send* in Specter Desktop, fill out the information, and click *Create unsigned transaction*.

    <img src="../../img/specter/create-transaction-screen.png" width="600">

    You will now see a screen listing the devices in your wallet. Select the device you want to sign the transaction (PSBT) with.

    <img src="../../img/specter/sign-transaction-button.png" width="400">

    Specter Desktop will display an animated QR code of the PSBT that you can scan with Krux by going to *Sign PSBT* in its main menu. After scanning, Krux should display info about the transaction for you to confirm before signing.

    <img src="../../img/pic-psbt.png" width="100">

    Once you have confirmed, Krux will begin animating a QR code of the signed transaction that you can scan into Specter Desktop. 
    
    <img src="../../img/pic-signed-psbt.png" width="100">

    In Specter Desktop, click *Scan signed transaction* and show it the QR. Each part of the QR code that is read will receive a ghost icon to indicate progress.

    <img src="../../img/specter/scan-signed-transaction-button.png" width="400">

    Once all parts of the QR code have been read, you should see a window popup asking you to broadcast the transaction. Click *Send transaction* and your transaction should be broadcasted to the network!
