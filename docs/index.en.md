# Krux

<img srcset="img/logo-150.png" align="right">

Krux is open-source firmware that enables anyone to build their own Bitcoin signing device via off-the-shelf parts. It runs on Kendryte K210 devices such as the [M5StickV](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/m5stickv) and [Maix Amigo](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Sipeed-Maix-Amigo-p-4689.html), converting them into airgapped devices that can sign transactions for multisignature and single-key wallets.

You can even attach a thermal printer and print out the QR codes that it generates.

To learn more about how Krux works, check out [Getting Started](getting-started).
