# Krux

<img srcset="img/logo-150.png" align="right">

Krux is an open-source DIY hardware signer for Bitcoin that can sign for multisignature and single-key wallets. It is a low-cost airgapped device built from off-the-shelf parts that communicates with wallet software via QR codes and wipes its memory after every session.

You can even attach a thermal printer and print out the QR codes that it generates.

To learn more about how Krux works, check out [Getting Started](getting-started).
