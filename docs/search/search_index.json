All operations in Krux are done via QR code. You can load your BIP-39 mnemonic, import a wallet descriptor, and sign transactions without ever having to plug the device into your computer (other than to flash the firmware). It reads QR codes in with its camera and writes QR codes out to its screen or to paper via an optional thermal printer attachment . Unlike a hardware wallet, Krux does not come with its own wallet software. Instead, you can use Krux with wallet coordinators to manage wallets and create transactions from your computer while never giving them access to your private keys. Krux was built to be vendor agnostic and works with many popular wallet coordinators, including: Specter Desktop Sparrow Wallet BlueWallet Electrum These applications let you create and manage your multisig and single-key wallets, generate receive addresses, and send funds by creating partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) that you can sign with your hardware wallets and signers, such as Krux.","title":"About"},{"location":"getting-started/advanced-usage/","text":"TODO Settings Changing to testnet in About","title":"Advanced Usage"},{"location":"getting-started/generating-a-mnemonic/","text":"Krux does not yet offer the ability to generate a mnemonic for you and instead expects you to bring your own.

In the future, we will make PGP-signed releases available for download. Requirements \u00b6 Hardware \u00b6 You will need the M5StickV, a supported microSD card , a USB-C cable, and a computer with a USB port to continue. Consult the part list for more information. Software \u00b6 You will need a computer with git and vagrant installed. Fetch the code \u00b6 In a terminal, run the following: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jreesun/krux This will pull down the Krux source code as well as the code for all its dependencies and put them inside a new krux folder. Note: When you wish to pull down updates to this repo, you can run the following inside the krux folder: git pull --recurse-submodules Spin up a virtual machine \u00b6 After you have installed Vagrant, run the following inside the krux folder to spin up a new VM: vagrant up Build the firmware inside the VM \u00b6 Run the following: vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux build-firmware' Note: This will take a while to complete. Probably a good time to make some coffee. Flash the firmware onto the M5StickV \u00b6 Connect the M5StickV to your computer via USB, power it on (left-side button), and run the following: vagrant reload && vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux flash-firmware' Note: vagrant reload is necessary in order for the newly-inserted USB device to be detected and passed through to the VM on startup. If this command fails with the error Failed to find device via USB. Is it connected and powered on? , make sure that your user has been added to the vboxusers group. On Mac or Linux, run the following command: sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers <user> If the flashing process fails midway through, check the connection, restart the device, and try the command again. If everything worked, when the device reboots you should see... a black screen! Build the software \u00b6 To build the software, run the following: vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux build-software en-US' Prefer a different language? You can replace en-US in the command above with one of the following supported locales: en-US (English) de-DE (German) fr-FR (French) Are we missing one? Make a PR! Note that due to memory constraints of the device, the translations for the language you wish to use must be baked into the software at this step and can't be changed at runtime. Flash the software onto the microSD card \u00b6 Plug the microSD card into your computer and make sure to format it as FAT-32. After mounting the card, take note of its path on your computer, for example on a Mac it might be located at /Volumes/SD . You can either manually copy over the contents of the build directory (not the folder itself) onto the root of the card, or run the following to do it for you: ./krux flash-software /Volumes/SD Note: This will erase everything on the card prior to copying. Boot it up \u00b6 Unmount and remove the microSD card from your machine, insert it into the M5StickV, and long-press its power button (left side) to boot it up.

The data in this code will be a plaintext space-separated string of the (English) words. This QR code can then be read by Krux for faster loads in the future. Public Key (xpub) \u00b6 This option displays your master extended public key (xpub) as text as well as a QR code. The QR code is in plaintext format and additionally includes derivation information (in BTC core format) that coordinator wallet software can use to determine whether it supports single-key or multisig wallets. After the xpub, a zpub or Zpub is shown depending on if a single-key or multisig wallet was chosen. This z/Zpub is usually not necessary unless you are using Electrum. If a thermal printer is attached, you can print either QR code. Wallet \u00b6 When you first select this option, you will be prompted to load a wallet.

Check Address \u00b6 This option turns on the camera and allows you to scan in a QR code of a receive address. If the address can be derived by your wallet, you will see it turn green, otherwise it will exhaustively search through as many addresses as you want until you choose to stop. After stopping, the address will be shown in red to indicate it could not be derived. This option exists as an extra security check to verify that the address your wallet coordinator has generated is authentic and belongs to your wallet. Sign PSBT \u00b6 This option turns on the camera and allows you to scan an animated QR code of a PSBT generated by your wallet coordinator software. Upon scanning, you will be shown a preview of how much BTC is being sent, who is receiving it, and the fee that is being paid.

The choice of single-key vs. multisig at this point will change the derivation information used to generate your extended master public key (xpub) which will affect how Specter Desktop classifies it. In Specter Desktop, you will need to import your public key by adding a new device. Press the Add new device button on the left side of the app. Krux is not listed as one of the available device types on the Add Device screen, so you will need to select the Other option. You will be taken to the Upload Keys screen where you can choose to Scan QR code . On your Krux, navigate to the Public Key (xpub) option under the main menu and show this QR code to Specter Desktop. It should import the xpub and display the Purpose as #0 Single Sig (Segwit) . Give the device a name and press Continue . You should now see the device in the devices list on the left side of the app. Now that you've added a device with your key to Specter Desktop, you can make a wallet using it. Press the Add new wallet button on the left side of the app. Choose to create a Single key wallet when it asks which type of wallet you want on the following screen.

In Krux, select the Wallet menu item option and scan the QR code. If it worked, Krux should display the wallet information that it loaded: Send coins \u00b6 Now, you can send funds! Go to Send in Specter Desktop, fill out the information, and click Create unsigned transaction . You will now see a screen listing the devices in your wallet. Select the device you want to sign the transaction (PSBT) with. Specter Desktop will display an animated QR code of the PSBT that you can scan with Krux by going to Sign PSBT in its main menu. After scanning, Krux should display info about the transaction for you to confirm before signing. Once you have confirmed, Krux will begin animating a QR code of the signed transaction that you can scan into Specter Desktop. In Specter Desktop, click Scan signed transaction and show it the QR.
