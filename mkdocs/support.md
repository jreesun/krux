# Support the Project
## Ways you can help
### Development
Audit the code, file an issue, make a pull request, or do all three. :)

### Documentation
I'd like to see Krux help as many people as possible, and in order to do that it needs good documentation. If you see a better way to word something, please make a PR, no matter how small.

### Translation
Krux has support for different languages. If it's missing a language or has an awkward translation, please file an issue or make a PR!

### Social
I'm an engineer, not a marketer. If you like Krux, help spread the word!

### Financial
Krux is a self-funded passion project. If you're a generous soul, tips are accepted at the following Bitcoin address:

Thank you!
