Krux does not yet offer the ability to generate a mnemonic for you and instead expects you to bring your own. See [here](https://vault12.rebelmouse.com/seed-phrase-generation-2650084084.html) for a good method to generate a mnemonic manually, or visit [Ian Coleman's BIP-39 Tool](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) offline or on an airgapped device to generate one automatically. 

It's worth noting that Ian's tool is able to take a mnemonic and generate a QR code that Krux can read in via the QR input method mentioned on the next page.
